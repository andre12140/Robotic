### Kinematic Project

The Kinematics Project can compute the kinematic model for a serial manipulator with 6 degrees-offreedom (dof). The direct kinematics function accepts a set of 6 angles and returns the position and orientation of the end-effector relative to a world frame. The inverse kinematics function accepts a position and orientation of the end-effector and returns a array of sets of angles for each joint.

### Car Simulation

This project consists of a simulation of an autonomous car operating inside IST campus. The car is able to move between any two arbitrary configurations along trajectories entirely contained inside the road areas normally reserved for vehicles. While moving the vehicle it complies with events defined prior to the starting of the mission such as: Stop traffic sign, Speed limit traffic sign,  Pedestrian crossing traffic sign and Pedestrian crossing at a pre-specified location and time.
